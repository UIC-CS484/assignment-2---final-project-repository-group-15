## Team Workflow Strategy

We are using feature-driven development to commit our work. We have one `main` branch and one `skeleton` branch. To implement a new feature in our project or squash some bugs, we pull from the `skeleton` branch and once the task is finished we commit the changes and push it into a new branch.

Using Discord, we notify our team members about the changes. After peer review, we merge the new branch with the `skeleton` branch.

After our weekly in-person team discussion and extensive testing, we merge the `skeleton` branch with the `main` branch.

Thus `main` is our release branch and `skeleton` is our staging branch.

We use GitHub project tools to track our overall progress, task assigning.
