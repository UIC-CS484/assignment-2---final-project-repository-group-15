## Testing
The current unit tests check password and email validity. These guarantee the user is correctly registering and logging in. They are tested in pairs, with one checking a correct input and should return true if the test passes, and the other checking incorrect values, which should return false if the test passes.
 - The first two tests check password length, and make sure it is at least 6 characters long.
 - The next two test password matching during registration.
 - The next two check for an @ character in an email.
 - Finally, the last two ensure that the email has a valid ending, such as ".com".
In future iterations, additional tests may test inputs in various ways against a database of user information. Tests may also check if the implentation of APIs is being performed correctly.
